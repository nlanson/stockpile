Need to do:
    
    Item page:
        [・] Implement search and category sorting.
        [・] Change icon to arrow.

    Location Page:
        [・] Last updated
    
    stock/location status:
        [  ] Highlight entire item and entire location if any of the item/location are below or nearing threshhold.
                - Location would be hard to implement ( Too resourceful as listening to live location feeds will take too much power )
                - Item page to high light categories could be possible ( Need to figure out how to loop over each item LIVE to change CSS colour
                   of the item from HTML or JS.)
        [・] ignore feature??
                - Implemented with dropdown -> Fixed to sliders (Feedback)
    
    
    beutify the app:
        css
            [・] Item increment/decrement buttons
                    - Green / Red
            [・] Unift background as black for all user prefs
                    - Light mode renders for dark now.
            [  ] Modals -> Cleaner look?
            [  ] Login Page -> More stuff 
                    - Toolbar that leads to unlock (Similar to MacQ)
                    - Greeting?
        
       [・] Item and Loc page title

    User Access:
        [  ] 1x Super User that can add and rm locations. All other users can just access DB?
        [  ] Edit and Delete Location only visible to super users.




    Add items from Location Page:
        [・] Be able to add an item from the location page
                - Click on item from loc page to redir to item page?


    Information Page:
        IDEA -
                When in a location page (eg. Cromwell ) and info modal is clicked, display information for the location
                    - Contact
                    - Address
                    - Map ?
                When in an item page (eg. Tomatoes ) and info modal is clicked, display information for the item
                    - Supplier
                    - Description
